    in battle memory.
    The overlay number is unknown (it may be compressed), but these are the battle-related functions called during the battle phase that I investigated.
  functions:
    - name: IncreasedTension
      address:
        jpn: 0x2087F78
      description: |-
        handles increased tension
        
        arguments are not yet understood
        return are not yet understood
    - name: movementPattern
      address:
        jpn: 0x208AC64
      description: |-
        It seems to be used to determine enemy actions
        
        arguments are not yet understood
        return are not yet understood
    - name: ProcessEnemyRandomAction
      address:
        jpn: 0x208AC64
      description: |-
        Process enemy behavior patterns.
        Called only for random actions, not if the action is program controlled. (probably)
        
        arguments are not yet understood
        return are not yet understood
    - name: IsCriticalHit
      address:
        jpn: 0x2158444
      description: |-
        Determine if the attack is a critical hit.
        
        arguments are not yet understood
        return: (bool)
    - name: shieldGuard
      address:
        jpn: 0x21585B0
      description: |-
        Handles guard with shield
        arguments are not yet understood
        return: bool
    - name: CriticalHit50
      address:
        jpn: 0x21D9F14
      description: |-
        Damage calculation for Hatchet Man and Thunder Thrust. If this returns 0, it will be a miss, and if it returns 1 or more, the returned damage will be inflicted as is.
        The process uses random numbers to calculate damage from 0.95 to 1.05 times the attack power.
        
        arguments are not yet understood
        return: If 0, it will be treated as a miss, if it is 1 or more, it will occur with the same technical hit damage returned by this function.
    - name: ProcessesHelmSplitter
      address:
        jpn: 0x21E3E2C
      description: |-
        Processes probability calculations for Helm Splitter(Kabutowari).
        Get a random value at 0x21e3e78 and compare at 0x21e3eec.
        The success rate is calculated by 100 * resistance to defense decrease. (0.5 etc) (probability calculation is another unknown function)
        
        arguments are not yet understood
        return are not yet understood
    - name: ProcessesStrikeWeakness
      address:
        jpn: 0x21E4E9C
      description: |-
        Processes probability calculation of Strike Weakness(vital point thrust)
        The result is determined by a random number 0x021e4f04, which varies depending on the monster's resistance, but basically succeeds if it is less than or equal to "(int) 12.5%".
