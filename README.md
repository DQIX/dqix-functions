# dq9Functions

dq9 function name sharing project using [resymgen](https://github.com/UsernameFodder/pmdsky-debug/blob/master/docs/resymgen.md) that comes with [pmdsky-debug](https://github.com/UsernameFodder/pmdsky-debug) project
Currently only a handful of functions from the jp version are provided

It includes some functions for division and decimal point processing, and by sharing them, the purpose is to omit some of the tedious discrimination work.
I'm not going to do a complete analysis.
